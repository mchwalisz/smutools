   <para>Spectool is a GUI for spectrum analyzers, such as the Wi-Spy and Wi-Spy 24x by Metageek.  It works with USB devices (with appropriate hardware) and networked devices.</para>
   <para>The <emphasis>planar graph</emphasis> shows a traditional oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer view of the wireless spectrum.</para>
   <para>The <emphasis>topographic graph</emphasis> shows a &quot;view through time&quot; of spectrum history.  The intensity of the graph is determined by the peak values over time.  The topo graph is especially useful for spotting trends and sources of interference.</para>
   <para>The <emphasis>spectrograph graph</emphasis> is a traditional waterfall style graph.</para>

   <para>Spectool USB support requires the tablet to be in USB Host mode.</para>
   <warning>USB Host mode on the N800 is (currently) not stable, and often causes the device to reboot.  Use at your own risk!</warning>
   <para>After connecting a Wi-Spy device, there will typically be an alert that the device is not supported.  Because the N8x0 tablets use a USB-OTG chipset, only specific devices are &quot;officially&quot; supported, and all other devices will generate this error.  It may safely be ignored.</para>
   <para>Spectool provides a utility for switching the device into host mode via software, if possible.  This utility is available under the USB menu.</para>
   <para>Host mode on the N810 is controlled via a Micro-USB-A cable.  It may be possible to control via software with the supplied Micro-USB-B cable.</para>
   <para>Host mode on the N800 is controlled via a custom Mini-USB-B cable with Mini-USB-A internal pinnings, or via software.</para>
